since a phrase at a certain loc can have different arc lengths as when computing min basic cycles the resulting cycles may be different, then we need to record every arc length wheneven seeing a phrase's occurrance. this file has done this task; however, the follow-up programs are not yet interfacing to this new cluster structure. we temporarily assume that this arc length issue would not impact our doc clustering results too much, so we didn't update the remainder of our programs. though, we will do in the future.
